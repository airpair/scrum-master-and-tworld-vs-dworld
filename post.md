## Are you able to handle team foible.

One day, my one of ex- colleague called me. He is facing a common issue in each sprint i.e. somehow few SBI not done due to acceptance testing failed or testing not complete.

I believe this is one of challenging task to develop a self organizing team. And when you see SBI not DONE because of testing left or acceptance test failed, that give clear message to show your skills to resolve it as a scrum master.

When we develop any software, we are actually communicating two worlds i.e. T-world testing world and D- World developer world.

Traditionally, testing activities have happened at the end of the development (coding) effort because a tester’s responsibilities included proving the requirements were met, ensuring the software worked, and finding bugs in the mostly finished product.

And when you enter in Agile development, you are individual but a part of team where no tag, title. Here are collaborative responsibilities, whether you are tester or developer. Only one world exists in agile scrum planet.

Agile processes mean testers are part of the delivery team and should try to be involved from the beginning of the project. You as a testers, there is a need to work as members of the team and to engage with others within the team, regardless of titles. If you see a task that needs doing and you have the skills to do that task, then just do it.

If developers are already testing their own code (and maybe even pairing up to review code as it is written), then what do you need testers for? Some organization compel tester learn to code, for continuous delivery and automating testing, this trend against tester. One of top banking organization switching to selenium tester. They do code like developer testing their unit/ integration testing. If such trend compiled, there will be no more testers in future which are against the software engineering law. Better to change the word to unit/ selenium test developer. Now question start you don’t need Testers – Or do you? Yes, we need tester but significant changes in their behavior [ignore selenium tester]. Yes, we need tester because even the best, most responsible and experienced developers make mistakes.

Below is some factor which makes better agile team.

Agile-Test, we look forward and speak to tester. Tell them to change the behavior keep less talking and more asking. For example, I would promote tester to ask, “Is there a bug here?” instead to stating, “There is a problem bug.” This drives my team to look deeper into the items by asking significant questions. In Agile general, we have PO, SM and team. Initial or in between sprint, tester can become a sprint business analyst. I keep asking tester to explore each sprint. I do not mind to ask silly question. You should keep asking and helping developer/ PO. My personal view “Developer do code, check code should not fail either unit or integration test. Tester is a functional analyst or business analyst of the team. Tester assists developer to check difference scenario in unit/ integration test. Test can ask in each sprint meeting to PO , example what if customer add item to wish list, and after 10 days item no more in active sate”. For this, I suggest tester to create their own model(using a pencil and paper). I believe you must involve tester in the start till end. Prepare tester to involve in each SBI, and allow their own design. They must share and ask what they think what should cover. They should create daily note where they keep sharing with team what they discover on same day. Next day in daily meeting, all are aware what they are doing today. It helps developer and team to reduce bugs. And increase the accepting criteria. Stories/ Items are short, chances the understanding can be differ. Tester they are much familiar with old way style which helps team to discover more ask [by tester] in sprint meeting.

It doesn’t matter how you are working, what method you follow - Agile or Waterfall doesn’t change the need for testers.

In - Agile, change the way you look. Do not just find the bug is only your responsibility, be a reporter, assistant, discover and explorer. Be a Team Player, you will see you are part of self organizing team.

As a Scrum Master, you need to develop such profiling in your team.
